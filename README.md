## Pre-requeriments ⛳

> Verify you have the correct `.rsa` key to enter differents servers.

- `dir ~\.ssh` In our case use `vagrant.rsa`

> Don't forget clone this repo and enter where is this file (README.md)

- `git clone <repo>`
- `cd <repo>`

If is your first time you will need install the following.

### Install applications 🔽

Before you begin, ensure you have Vagrant installed. If not, follow these steps:

1. **Install Vagrant**:
   - 🌐 [Download Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads)
   - Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

2. **Install Vagrant Plugins**:
   - Open your terminal or command prompt.
   - Run the following commands:
     ```
     vagrant plugin install vagrant-vbguest
     vagrant plugin install vagrant-virtualbox_WSL2
     ```

3. **Install VirtualBox**:
   - 🌐 [Download VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
   - Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

## Software Requirements ⭕

- **Operating System**: Windows 10 Pro N 64-bit
- **Virtualization Software**: VirtualBox 7.0

## Getting Started Environment ✨

In terminal:

1. Clone the repository for your Ansible project.

   `git clone <repo>`

2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.

   `cd <repo>`

3. Open your favorite IDE.

   `code .`

4. Aprovision the virtual machine.

   `vagrant up`

5. Enter in VM need run.

   `vagrant ssh`

## Verifying Correct Installation 🆗

1. Navigate to molecule scenarios.

   `cd sre/env/extensions`

2. Run the following commands.

   `molecule create -s setup_ok` and `molecule converge -s setup_ok`

3. If everything is ok, you will see: `"Your installation was successfully ✅🍻"`

## Resources 📚

Is strongly recommended read the following documentation.

[Ansible collections and molecule](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)

## Cheat Sheet Commands 📃

> All commands require of a specific path where execute.

- Create a collection: 

   Path: ./

   `ansible-galaxy collection init sre.<new-collection>`

- Create a role: 

   Path: ./sre/env/setup_ok/roles

   `ansible-galaxy role init <new-role>`

- Create a scenario: 

   Path: ./sre/env/setup_ok/extensions

   `molecule init scenario <new-scenario>`

- Instance enviornment: 

   Path: ./sre/env/setup_ok/extensions

   `molecule create -s <new-scenario>`

- Test your code:  

   Path: ./sre/env/setup_ok/extensions

   `molecule converge -s <new-scenario>`

- Login environment:

   Path: ./sre/env/setup_ok/extensions

   `molecule login -s <new-scenario>`

## Additional Notes 📝

- Make sure virtualization is enabled in your BIOS settings for optimal performance.
- Utilize molecule extensively for testing your Ansible roles.
- Ensure proper documentation is maintained for your Ansible project.

> Happy coding and testing! 🚀🔬
